# Challenge 1: Kickstarter analysis

## 1. Overview of project 
The main objective of this project is performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
Louise wants to find out how the launch date affect the behavior of differente campaigns. On the other hand, seems interesting to discover the influence of the goal amount in the outcome of each one of the campaigns

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
First of all the amount of data make this analysis very challenging, you need to get use to have a full date set screen.
Another challenge is that my Exel version is in spanish, so I struggled a little bit finding the functions as the text was explaining

Talking about the analysis, is very important to have in mind the distribution of data in a pivot table. Turns out very easy to fill the fields and end up having a mess with pivot tables.

After the analysis of the Category and Subcategory fields using pivot tables, it was noticable that the main category with successful outcomes was the theater one. Further analysis of Subcategory made clear that the "plays" section was by far the largest amount of successful outcomes.


## 3. Results
> ### 3.1 Theater Outcomes VS Launch
Acording to the "Theater outcomes based on launch date" section, May is the best month of the year to launch a kickstarter campaign, since it has the highes value of all year. It would need further assesment to discover the reasons for this behavior.

As you can see in the following image, the blue line representing the successfun campaigns has a large 111 peak in the middle of the year, descending drastically to the end of the year reaching a 37 value on december.

> ### 3.2 Outcomes based on goals

According to the "Outcomes based on goals" section, successful outcomes are obtained when the goal amount is less than $5,000, with a 74% of success projects. This is important to select the correct goal amount in order to obtain higher possibilites to success.

On the other hand, goals amount higher than $25,000 turns out in a fail outcome most of the time, as you can see in the following image.
