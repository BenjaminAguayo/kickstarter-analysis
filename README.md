# Challenge 1: Kickstarter analysis

## 1. Overview of project 
The main objective of this project is performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
Louise wants to find out how the launch date affect the behavior of differente campaigns. On the other hand, seems interesting to discover the influence of the goal amount in the outcome of each one of the campaigns

## 2. Analysis and Challenges
First of all the amount of data make this analysis very challenging, you need to get use to have a full date set screen.
Another challenge is that my Exel version is in spanish, so I struggled a little bit finding the functions as the text was explaining

Talking about the analysis, is very important to hace in mind the distribution of data in a pivot table. Turns out very easy to fill the fields and end up having a mess with pivot tables
